## üöÄ Getting Started

1.  **Fork the Repository**: Create a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.
2.  **Clone Your Fork**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/stats.git
    cd stats
    ```
3.  **Create a New Branch**: Always work on a separate branch for your changes.

    # or fix/your-bug-fix
    ```
4.  **Make Your Changes**: Implement features, fix bugs, or add data.

## üìù Semantic Commits

To maintain a clear and organized commit history, we use [Semantic Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). This helps us to automatically generate the `CHANGELOG.md` and quickly understand the purpose of each change.

The general format is: `<type>(optional scope): <description>`

**Common Types:**

*   `feat`: A new feature.
*   `fix`: A bug fix.
*   `docs`: Documentation only changes.
*   `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc.).
*   `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature.
*   `perf`: A code change that improves performance.
*   `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests.
*   `build`: Changes that affect the build system or external dependencies (examples: gulp, broccoli, npm).
*   `ci`: Changes to our CI configuration files and scripts (examples: Travis, Circle, BrowserStack, SauceLabs).
*   `chore`: Other changes that don't modify source code or test files.
*   `revert`: Reverts a previous commit.

**Examples:**

*   `feat: add endpoint for tower data`
*   `fix(cards): correct card elixir retrieval bug`
*   `docs: update contribution section`
*   `refactor(data): optimize card data structure`

## ‚úçÔ∏è Code Style

*   **Simplicity and Readability**: Write clear, concise, and easy-to-understand code.
*   **Descriptive Names**: Use meaningful and consistent naming conventions for data fields and file names.
*   **Consistency**: Ensure data formats (e.g., JSON structure, field types) are consistent across all data files.
*   **Accuracy**: Verify the correctness of all data added or modified.
